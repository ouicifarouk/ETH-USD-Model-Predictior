# ETH-USD-Model-Predictior
A supervised learning machine learning model of the linear regression type with real-time hourly data for the last 23 months updated hourly from yfinance was used to predict the highest and lowest price of ETH against USD The RMSE model had an average squared error of approximately 15 
The model is good for learning and using data, and for observing its accuracy, especially since it achieves an average squared error of 15 and a standard deviation of approximately 3. 


🚨🚨:Despite its good accuracy, the model cannot be relied upon definitively for managing financial risks or even for accurately predicting prices. Anyone who uses it without proper knowledge and understanding of its purpose bears full responsibility for any financial losses, and I do not recommend relying on it as a primary tool. 

Two other types of models were included for testing (both yield worse results due to their nature): Random Forest and Desicion Forest. You can change the LinearRegression() field to the same names as the commands being called to test them.
